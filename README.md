# U.S.-Government-Defense-Outlays-Analysis
Analysis of national defense outlays submitted as part of a homework assignment for PHYS 3101 - Federal R&amp;D. 

Taught by Professor Patrick Gallagher. Former director of NIST and former chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh. 

__Goal of Assignment: __

**The goal of this session is to use the Science and Engineering IndicatorsLinks to an external site. from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics at NSF. 

Imagine you are on the staff at OMB.  Your boss asks to prepare a "one-pager" on how a particular national need has impacted federal R&D funding.  (Because you work at OMB, you can also use their historical dataLinks to an external site..)

To address the question you will need to:

(1) identify a national need, problem or priority to choose to examine.  (Hint: choosing something between 1990-2020 will be earlier to find comparative data);

(2) explore the data (reports, charts and tables) from the S&E indicators and identify a funding trend that might be correlated to the national need you identified.  

(3) summarize in a few sentences or bullet points what impact you saw (or didn't see) and draw a conclusion about the impact that national need or priority has had on funding.  You may choose to look at total federal funding, a portion of federal funding (e.g. basic research, or university-based research), or agency-specific funding.  **
