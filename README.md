__Goal of Assignment:__

_The goal of this session is to use the Science and Engineering IndicatorsLinks to an external site. from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics at NSF._

_Imagine you are on the staff at OMB.  Your boss asks to prepare a "one-pager" on how a particular national need has impacted federal R&D funding.  (Because you work at OMB, you can also use their historical dataLinks to an external site..)_

_To address the question you will need to:_

_(1) identify a national need, problem or priority to choose to examine.  (Hint: choosing something between 1990-2020 will be earlier to find comparative data);_

_(2) explore the data (reports, charts and tables) from the S&E indicators and identify a funding trend that might be correlated to the national need you identified._  

_(3) summarize in a few sentences or bullet points what impact you saw (or didn't see) and draw a conclusion about the impact that national need or priority has had on funding.  You may choose to look at total federal funding, a portion of federal funding (e.g. basic research, or university-based research), or agency-specific funding._
